# TDD Spring Boot FizzBuzz 

Spring Boot Application with an REST-API, that receives an input value and returns a result list in JSON format.
By entering a number the application returns a list of values starting from 1 up the entered number considering the following rules:

 

- If number is divisible by 3, then you need to output Fizz
- If number is divisible by 5, then you need to output Buzz
- If number is divisible by 3 and 5 both, then you need to output FizzBuzz
- Else you just need to output the next number

# Built With
